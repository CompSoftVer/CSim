messages on channels definition for management of auxiliary variables
To get track of messages added and removed to/from a channel 
messages are stored in an auxiliary variable. The queue for a channel ch
is always equal to the initial value of the queue plus the auxiliary variables
of the processes sending a message to the channel, minus the auxiliary variables
of the processes removing/clearing messages from the channel. *}
